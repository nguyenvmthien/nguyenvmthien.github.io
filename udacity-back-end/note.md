a# How the Web Works

## World Wide Web
- The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents. Th√© documents are made up of something called HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language. This is the basic for almost every webpage. Even though there can be, you know, documents, images, videos and all sort of things online. HTML is what glues everything together, and the links between these pages called hyperlinks or links for short, is what makes the web, web-like

- The web was invented in the early 1990s, and has something on the order of 30 bilion pages.

- HTML is the heart of the web. The Web is basically made up of these documents that can do a number of things.
So HTML is made up of text content *what you see*, markup *what it looks like*, references to *e.g. images + videos* other documents.
### HTML Tags
- Element = Opening Tag + Content + Closing Tag
- For example: \<name> Contents \</name>, **bold tag** \<b>contents\</b>, *italics* \<em>contents\</em>
#### Missing End Tag
What happens when missing end tag?
### HTML Attributes
- \<TAG [ATTR="value"]>Contents\</TAG>
- for example: \<a href="facebook.com">hehe\</a>
- adding images: \<img src="url" alt="text">
--- alt stands for alternate, this is text that gets displayed when the image doesn't load. "required"
- paragraph tag: \<p>contents\</p>
#### Inline - Block
- Inline: \<br> likes as "\n"; \<b>, \<em>, \<img>
- Block: \<p>\</p>

#### Span - Div
\<span><TEXT\</span>

\<div>TEXT\</div>

Difference between Span and Div: **Span is inline**. **Div is block**.

# Components of the Web
The major pieces are you, your computer running a Web browser, the Internet, and servers. 
**Your browser** makes requests via **Internet** to **servers**.
These requests are using protocol called **HTTP** and the servers respond with files that your browser dislays. 
These **servers** are computers just like yours except they are optimized for sitting in a closet and hosting files rather than sitting on your desk.
**HTTP** is a simple protocol for browser communicate with thesee servers.
